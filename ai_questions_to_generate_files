Create a main.go file with necessary content to test if Go works correctly on workstation.
That should include:
- creation of a test file that tests one function defined in main.go
- usage of gofmt, create some flaw in the code and fix the styling using gofmt, confirming that it works
- define what to do in order to build and execute it







define a bash script to prepare above files and execute necessary commands








can you extend the testing and validation so we are sure that the binary was built, it exist, the files exist . Please set the environment variables for any paths used and be sure that it works from any working directory (the script itself)
